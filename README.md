# humhub-schedule
A Humhub module to help participants schedule events and meetings


This module will provide an option box when creating a new event or meeting in Humhub

It let's the event organiser set a series of slots (which could be from 15 minutes to a week) from which invitees can choose

Once enough invitees have responded with their avilability for each slot, the organiser can complete the event set-up and invite paricipants to the most popular timeslot.

*To schedule meetings this module requires #humhub-modules-calendar and/or #humhub-modules-meetings*
